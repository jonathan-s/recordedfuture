== SPLUNK PHANTOM

[sidebar]
Splunk Phantom is event-based to do the first triage of events that is sent to it. It will
gather information about the entities involved to determine the next actions: whether
the event can be closed immediately, if there is enough information to decide on the
next action and/or to hand it over to a SOC engineer.

==== DEVELOPMENT PAIN POINTS
[square]
* Limited space to display information
* Not suited for the large amount of data that is accessible via our API

==== NEEDS
[square]
* A static API
* Structured information on which to base decisions, cannot connect dots on its own
* Clear information about what the information means and how reliable/actionable it is

==== USAGE GOALS
[square]
* Decrease the number of alerts that SOC engineers need to get involved with directly
* Decrease the time to react to threats
* Create containers used for forensic investigation into threats and evidence gathering

==== WINNING STRATEGY
[square]
* Amazingly good a working 24/7 without breaks
* Likes calculations and handling large amounts of data when fitted
with rules and playbooks to follow

automate the annoying/time consuming
automate the things with a lot of steps
