# RELEASE NOTES

## VERSION 1.2

This version is a complete re-write of the app. It is not backwards compatible
with previous versions.

### Upgrading

When upgrading from a previous version of the app it will be necessary to do
the following steps for each playbook that uses the app:

1. Verify that the asset configuration is still valid.
1. Determine if it is still possible to use "ip reputation", "file reputation",
   or "domain reputation" or if it necessary to switch to the corresponding
   "intelligence" action. To switch or not depends on what results are
   used.
1. Adapt any component that uses data from an action in the app. Most JSON
   paths have changed.

### Changed Actions

1. **ip reputation**: the action returns a smaller set of information 
   compared to previous versions. The new action "ip intelligence" returns
   a similar set of information as the previous version, the format is
   changed however.
1. **domain reputation**: the action returns a smaller set of information 
   compared to previous versions. The new action "domain intelligence" returns
   a similar set of information as the previous version, the format is
   changed however.
1. **file reputation**: the action returns a smaller set of information 
   compared to previous versions. The new action "file intelligence" returns
   a similar set of information as the previous version, the format is
   changed however.
1. **lookup vulnerability**: the action as been renamed to 
   **vulnerability reputation**. It returns a smaller set of information 
   compared to previous versions. The new action "vulnerability intelligence" 
   returns a similar set of information as the previous version, the format is
   changed however.
