# Docker support for Phantom development

Launch the environment:

`env MYPHANTOMUSER=xxx MYPHANTOMPASS=xxxx docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml`

The MYPHANTOMxxxx are valid credentials to https://my.phantom.us as this is needed to 
start the Phantom server image. Look in LastPass if you don't have your own.
